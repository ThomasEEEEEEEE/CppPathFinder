# CppPathFinder
This application shows off the A* algorithm. The user is shown a grid of tiles. They can place a start tile, an end tile, or an obstacle anywhere on the grid. Every time a new tile is placed, the algorithm will find the shortest path and display it.

Left clicking on a tile will place an obstacle.
Left clicking while holding CTRL on a tile will place the start tile.
Right clicking while holding CTRL on a tile will place the end tile.

This application is made using OneLoneCoder's olcPixelGameEngine.
